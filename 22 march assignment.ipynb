    "Interpreting the result depends on the magnitude and sign of the correlation coefficient. A positive correlation coefficient indicates a positive linear relationship between the variables, meaning that as one variable increases, so does the other.

The magnitude of the correlation coefficient indicates the strength of the relationship, with larger magnitudes indicating stronger relationships.\n",

    "For example, if we find a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.8 between the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores, we can interpret this as a strong positive linear relationship between these two variables. This means that as students spend more time studying for an exam, their final exam scores tend to increase. Conversely, if we find a Pearson correlation coefficient of -0.5 between these two variables, we can interpret this as a moderate negative linear relationship between them. This means that as students spend more time studying for an exam, their final exam scores tend to decrease."
